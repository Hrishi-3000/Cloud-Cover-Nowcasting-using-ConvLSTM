ConvLSTM Layer
The model leverages ConvLSTM2D, a combination of convolutional layers and LSTM units, to predict cloud cover:

ConvLSTM2D Layer: Captures spatiotemporal features by applying convolutional operations on the input sequence of images.
Batch Normalization: Normalizes the output of each convolutional layer to improve training speed and stability.
Residual Connections: Introduced in the model to allow for deeper layers without vanishing gradients, ensuring that important features are passed forward.
TimeDistributed Layer: Allows the model to apply 2D convolution to each frame in a sequence independently.
Sigmoid Activation: The final output layer uses the sigmoid activation function to output predicted cloud cover values in the range [0, 1].

Model Evaluation
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
SSIM is a metric used to measure the similarity between two images. It evaluates luminance, contrast, and structure. The closer the SSIM score is to 1, the more similar the two images are.
MSE (Mean Squared Error)
MSE calculates the average squared differences between the predicted and actual values, providing a quantitative measure of the prediction error. Lower MSE indicates better predictions.
